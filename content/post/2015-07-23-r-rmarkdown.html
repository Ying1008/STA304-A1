<h1>Discribe Data</h1>
<p>This data set contains demographic, geographic, and severity information for all confirmed and probable cases reported to and managed by Toronto Public Health since the first case was reported in January 2020. This includes cases that are sporadic (occurring in the community) and outbreak-associated. The data are extracted from the provincial communicable disease reporting system (iPHIS) and Toronto’s custom COVID-19 case management system (CORES) and combined for reporting. Each line summarizes information for an individual case.
The data will be completely refreshed and overwritten on a weekly basis.</p>

<div id="variables-used" class="section level1">
<h1>Variables used</h1>
<p>【Source of Infection】 - The most likely way that sporadic cases acquired their COVID-19 infection. Only the most likely exposure for each case is reported. Exposures that occurred up to 14 days before symptoms start are potential acquisition sources, and can include(
#Travel:Travel outside of Ontario.
#Close contact with a case: Was in close contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19 case (e.g., reside in the same household).
#Institutional setting: Institutional settings includes, but not limited to: long-term care homes, acute care hospitals…
#Healthcare setting: includes, but not limited to: family physician, dentist, ophthalmologist, sports doctor.
#Community: Cases with no reported travel outside of Ontario, no known close contact with a COVID-19 case.
#Pending Information on source of infection pending.
#Unknown/missing Source of infection not identified or missing.
#N/A: Outbreak-associated cases.)
【Episode Date】 - The episode date is a derived variable that best estimates when the disease was acquired, and refers to the earliest available date from: symptom onset (the first day that COVID-19 symptoms occurred), laboratory specimen collection date, or reported date.
【Client Gender】 -Self-reported gender.</p>
